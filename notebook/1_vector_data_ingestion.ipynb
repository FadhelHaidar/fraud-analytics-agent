       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\txt\\\\Understanding Credit Cards Fraud.txt'}, page_content=\"Understanding Credit Card Frauds**\\n\\nLOCKOUT MECHANISMS**\\n\\nAutomatic card number generators represent one of the new technological tools frequently utilized by fraudsters. These programs, easily downloadable from the Web, are able to generate thousands of 'valid' credit card numbers. The traits of frauds initiated by a card number generator are the following: • Multiple transactions with similar card numbers (e.g. same Bank Identification Number (BIN)) • A large number of declines\\n\\nAcquiring banks/merchant sites can put in place prevention mechanisms specifically designed to detect number generator attacks.\\n\\nFRAUDULENT MERCHANTS**\\n\\nBoth MasterCard and Visa publish a list of merchants who have been known for being involved in fraudulent transactions in the past. These lists (NMAS - from Visa and MATCH - from MasterCard) could provide useful information to acquirers right at the time of merchant recruitment preventing potential fraudulent transactions.\\n\\n**Recent Developments in Fraud Management**\"),\n",

However, this is a challenging trade-off between the response time for processing an authorisation request and extent of screening that should be carried out.\\n\\nSIMPLE RULE SYSTEMS**'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\txt\\\\Understanding Credit Cards Fraud.txt'}, page_content=\"SIMPLE RULE SYSTEMS**\\n\\nSimple rule systems involve the creation of 'if...then' criteria to filter incoming authorisations/transactions. Rule-based systems rely on a set of expert rules designed to identify specific types of high-risk transactions. Rules are created using the knowledge of what characterizes fraudulent transactions. For instance, a rule could look like - If transaction amount is > $5000 and card acceptance location = Casino and Country = 'a high-risk country'.\\n\\nFraud rules enable to automate the screening processes leveraging on the knowledge gained over time regarding the characteristics of both fraudulent and legitimate transactions. Typically, the effectiveness of a rule-based system will increase over time, as more rules are added to the system. It should be clear, however, that ultimately the effectiveness of the system depends on the knowledge and expertise of the person designing the rules.\"),\n",
